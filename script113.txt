You will be given the high street price (normPrice), the duty free discount (discount) 
and the cost of the holiday.

For example, if a bottle cost £10 normally and the discount in duty free was 10%, 
you would save £1 per bottle. If your holiday cost £500, the answer you should return
 would be 500.

All inputs will be integers. Please return an integer. Round down.
