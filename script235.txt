This lesson we learn the last three methods: isArray() indexOf() and toString(). Each of these three methods have their own purpose and put them together just because this is the last lesson of arrayObject ;-)

For more information, please refer to:

Array.prototype.isArray()
Array.prototype.indexOf()
Array.prototype.toString()
Here are some examples to help us understand the use of isArray() indexOf and toString():

isarray() is a static method, its main-body can only be Array. it returns a Boolean value, which means that the parameter is an array or not. See example:

var a=[1], b=1, c="1", d={1:1}, e=true;
console.log(Array.isArray(a)); //true    a is an array
console.log(Array.isArray(b)); //false   b is not an array
console.log(Array.isArray(c)); //false   c is not an array
console.log(Array.isArray(d)); //false   d is not an array
console.log(Array.isArray(e)); //false   e is not an array
It is often used to check the validity of the parameters. There are many other ways to determine the parameter type, and we will learn from the next lesson.

We have seen indexOf() used for stringObject. The array object can also be used. its Usage is basically the same as the string object.

It's usually used to determine whether an array contains an element or not. Its return value is the index of element. If there is no such element in the array, return -1. See example:

var arr=[1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(arr.indexOf(1));             //output: 0  arr[0]=1
console.log(arr.indexOf(5));             //output: 4  arr[4]=5
console.log(arr.indexOf(6));             //output: -1 no 6 in the array

All objects in JS have toString() methods. Its function is to return a string representation of an object. Converting an object into a string, toString() is not the easiest way to do it. A lot of ways to do this:
